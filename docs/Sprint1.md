## Plans
 - We drew up user stories, available below
 - We plan on finishing the basic Go implementation of a server on the backend
 - We plan on getting a welcome page and a calendar page working on the frontend

## Reflection
 - We were successfully able to implement the login system with user IDs using Go on the backend
 - We developed individual components and put together a basic layout for the frontend
 - We created a login screen, a settings screen, and a calendar screen
 - The welcome screen was not completed because we felt like the settings and calendar pages were more important. This way the backend devs can start working with those pages.



## User Stories
- As a user, I would like to put my events in and have a clear way to determine what type of event it is.
- As a user, I would like to have some control over how the system automatically prioritizes my events.
- As a user, I want to be able to look at my schedule through different “views” (daily, weekly, and monthly schedule views).
- As a user, I would like to be able to customize my personal schedule with different colors/themes.
- As a user, I would like to get notifications to be sent to my email addressing certain events at certain times.
- As a user, I want a clear and easy to use interface that isn't time consuming to add events to so it doesn’t feel like a chore to use.
- As a user, I would like to be given relevant suggestions on how I could better manage my tasks.
- As a user, I would want this application to feel extremely personalized and like a personal assistant.
- As a moderator, I would like to be able to track traffic to the service.
- As a user, I would like to manually separate events into groups to denote classes, clubs, or certain types of events.
- As a developer, I want to see relevant feedback on the application so I can update the application accordingly.
