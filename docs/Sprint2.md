## Work Synopsis
### Frontend
 - We fleshed out the calendar page design with more features, like an event filter and a view switcher.
 - We created a radio button group that allows us to switch between week, month, and day views for the schedule. The day view has not yet been created, but we have made the month and week views.
 - We updated the preferences page to include options to change the header color and switch between light/dark mode.
 - We built a microservice to locally store dates and preferences across pages on the site.
 - We created an "Add Event" modal, which allows you to input an event's name, category, and date.
 - We lined up the month intervals with the days of the week, so that the numbering of days on the calendar lines up with real-time. For example, this year, March starts on a Wednesday. On the calendar, the days are numbered beginning on Wednesday.
 - We added animations to switching months.
