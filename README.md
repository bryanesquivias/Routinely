# Routinely

Routinely is an app built in Golang and Typescript. It is being built for UF's Intro to Software Engineering class for Spring 2023.

We are using Angular with Clarity Design to make our frontend.

Routinely will be able to automatically prioritize and schedule events for the user, using an easy to use calendar interface.
